      "@value": "Since joining Cardano in 2017, I have been at the forefront of promoting its adoption in the real world. Shortly after joining, I made our hotel in Barcelona the first business in the world to accept ADA, establishing a deep connection between our establishment and the Cardano ecosystem. Over the years, we've given the hotel a distinct Cardano identity, with branded keychains, staff uniforms, artwork, and more.  Located in the vibrant city of Barcelona, our hotel has become a central hub for the Cardano community, hosting over 10 events, including two support events for the Cardano Summit. As the host of \"The Cardano Hotel Podcast,\" I have recorded over 100 episodes in collaboration with around 10 other ecosystem members, fostering a platform for dialogue and growth. Additionally, I've partnered with CardanoSpot on another podcast and recently launched Media3, an ambitious project aimed at creating multiple YouTube channels featuring innovative shows that blend Cardano content with existing television game show formats."
