My primary mission within the ecosystem is education. You can find my posts on the X platform.\n\nI feel a strong sense of duty to become a DRep and help enhance the decentralization of Cardano.",
    "objectives": "As a DRep, I am committed to upholding core blockchain principles such as decentralization, liveness, security, immutability, and sustainability.\n\nIn this role, I recognize the importance of long-term economic sustainability, especially as governance bodies make decisions regarding ADA withdrawals from the treasury.\n\nI will always vote with Cardano's long-term economic sustainability in mind.\n",

    "qualifications": "With 20 years of experience as a programmer, I've specialized in building telecommunications and embedded systems, focusing heavily on protocols throughout my career.\n\nI've been part of the Cardano community since 2017 and have served as a Cardano ambassador for a significant period. This year, I also joined Intersect.\n\nIntersect chose me as one of the DRep training leaders. I possess a strong understanding of governance. ",
